# Natural Selection Simulator

Simplified visualization for how natural selection affects populations. Good for educational purposes in order to understand the concept, as well as just for fun to mess around with.

## Download

See the [releases page](https://github.com/evanw555/NaturalSelectionSim/releases) to download the simulation. The simulation runs as a standalone JAR, as it was developed purely using built-in Java graphics and GUI components.
